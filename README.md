# Pupper :dog:

## Description

Finding the right animal can be a difficult task. Heading to your local corporate brick and mortar pet shop just abuses the adoption system, and puts more cash in the hands of conglomerates. Even heading to your local shelter to browse around could leave you feeling guilty that you can’t adopt them all, and end up making you depressed. 

Here’s where Pupper comes in! 

A user friendly web application that allows users to sign up, and quickly access animal shelter data to locate and pick their next pup. It's modeled after a tinder styled interface, so you can swipe right to match with your next pup, or swipe left not match.

So long Sarah Mclachlan guilt trip! Pupper will help you find your new best friend, while providing some much needed adoption assistance to your local animal shelter. It’s a win win for everyone.
